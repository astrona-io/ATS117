# Alert When A Node Is Sealed

- **ID:** CAPSTONE
- **Slug:** ats-117-capstone-030
- **Author:** Paris Nakita Kejser
- **Type:** Astrona graded capstone

Graded capstone for OpenBao in the namespace(s) `openbao` and `monitoring`. Read `question.md` for the task; `solution.md` is the walkthrough.
Built from the OpenBao 2.7 documentation and not yet run (see the repository `CLAUDE.md`).
The plumbing is generated: change shared helpers in every environment.

## Run it

```sh
astrona run -c .
astrona submit
astrona destroy ats-117-capstone-030
```
